# 😊 Mood Journal App

🚀 **My First ReactJS Project**  
Mood Journal is a beautifully simple and interactive mood-tracking web app that lets users log how they feel using expressive emojis, write short reflective notes, and visualize their emotional trends over time.

This project was developed as a hands-on introduction to **ReactJS**, focusing on component-based design, state management, and modern frontend techniques such as animations and dark/light theming. It’s fully deployed on **Vercel** and accessible to everyone!
