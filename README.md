# 😊 Mood Journal App

🚀 **My First ReactJS Project** — Mood Journal is a simple yet engaging mood tracking web app that allows users to log how they feel using expressive emojis and optional notes. It also displays mood history and charts to visualize emotional patterns over time.

This project was built as part of my journey into ReactJS, focusing on component-based architecture, state management, and modern UI/UX techniques like animations and theme toggling. I’ve also deployed it using Vercel to make it publicly accessible.
