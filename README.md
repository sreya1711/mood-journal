# 😊 Mood Journal App

🚀 **A Simple Way to Understand How You Feel**  
Mood Journal is a clean, expressive, and interactive web app that helps you reflect on your emotions using cute emojis and quick notes. Visualize your mood journey with beautiful charts, floating animations, and a minimalist UI — all without the need to log in!

This was my **first hands-on project with ReactJS**, where I explored component-based architecture, state handling, theming, and delightful frontend animations. Hosted on **Vercel**, it’s accessible to anyone who wants to check in with themselves.
